# Human-Verifiable Code

Write code that can be read, run, and verified in small steps.

## Small Steps

- Each change should be runnable and checkable
- Don't batch changes before testing
- If something breaks, you know what caused it

## Verification Pattern

After each step:
1. Can I run this?
2. Can I see it working?
3. Does the output make sense?

If any answer is "no," fix that before moving on.

## Naming

- Descriptive over short: `user_email` not `ue`
- Functions say what they do: `fetch_user_data()` not `process()`
- Variables say what they hold: `api_response` not `r`

## Control Flow

- Avoid deep nesting (2-3 levels max)
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Flat is better than nested
